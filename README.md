Panopticon is a debugger-powered tracer for Python code to quickly visualize and explore code execution. Traces generated are [Catapult](<https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult/+/HEAD/tracing/README.md>) compatible â€” available at \`chrome://tracing\` if you\'re using Chrome. 

**Alpha**: I'm still working on adding tests, polishing the api, and cleaning up the code in general. Expect the API to change drastically as it meanders towards v1. It should still be immediately useful as a debugging tool. Please report issues if you come across bugs!

Usage
-----

You can read a more detailed guide with several examples of simple Python programs, different interfaces to visualize them and the corresponding traces at [explog.in/panopticon](https://explog.in/panopticon/index.html).


### Run a command directly

```sh
python3 -m panopticon -c "print('hello')" -o print_hello.trace
```

### Run a file

```sh
python3 -m panopticon -o file.trace file.py 
```

### In code

```python
from panopticon import record_trace

with record_trace("print_hello.trace"):
    print("Hello")
```


### Probe a specific function
It can be tricky to control how a program is executed: using the probe decorator allows instrumenting a specific function instead.

```python
from panopticon.probe import probe
from panopticon.trace import StreamingTrace

@probe(trace=StreamingTrace(open("probe.trace", "w")))
def myfunction():
    ...
```

Asynchronous Functions
----------------------

Python supports suspending and continuing execution of a frame through generators, coroutines and asynchronous generators. Panopticon creates \"flow\" events to connect a single frame executing through time, making it easier to visualize what\'s actually happening.

You can enable/disable connections for different types of functions by choosing to enable/disable flow events in Catpult (top-right).
